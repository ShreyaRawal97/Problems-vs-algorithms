To solve this, initialize a list with a negative infinity in order to find max value in list, and initialize with positive infinity to find the minimum value. Iterate throughout the list and make comparisons to find the minimum and max values.

Time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1). here, n is the input size which is size of array.
