First RouteTrieNode class has been initialized, and it has attributes value, handler, and reference to next node. Then, RouteTrie class has been initialized using a node of RouteTrieNode.

The time complexity is:
O(1) for RouteTrieNode and O(n) for RouteTrie
The space complexity is:
O(1) for RouteTrieNode and O(n) for RouteTrie as lookup and handler take up space.
